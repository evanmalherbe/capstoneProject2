# HyperionDev Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp - Level 1 Task 15 - Capstone project 2 - Online store

## Description
This is the capstone project for level 1 of the HyperionDev Full Stack Development Bootcamp, and so it is very important, as it required me to use all the skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery that I have learned thusfar. This online store has a working shopping cart that allows users to add products. It then calculates the total cost, adds VAT and allows the user to choose delivery options and add discount vouchers.

## Instructions
These were the instructions I was given to guide me in creating this website. 

**Note: Feel free to reuse any work you have already done for this project. Your online store is required to implement the following:**

* Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following JavaScript functionality:
    * Create a functional shopping cart for your online store.
    * Allow a “quick add to cart” from the catalogue page.
    * Each product’s page must also have the option to “add to cart”.
    * When an item is added, an alert should tell the user what the current total is.
    * Create a new html page for the cart section which allows the user to see what is in their cart, each item’s price, and the total cost (remember to add VAT!)
    * Create a form which allows for “discount coupons”.
    * Create forms to allow a user to select “collection” or “delivery”.
    * Create forms for different delivery options.
    * Your total should change based on what delivery option is chosen and if a certain coupon is applied.
    * Create a “confirm order” button which alerts the user that their order was successful and generates them a reference number (keyword: generate)
    * Within the entirety of your site, you should have at least the following jQuery functionality:
        * A function which contains hiding/showing.
        * A drop-down menu.
        * Animation effects.
        * A function with chained effects.

### Technologies
This project uses:
* HTML 5 
* CSS 3
* Javascript ECMAScript 2021
